# Veda

The following Nakshatras are mutually repelling and afflicting to each other:
Asvinni & Jyeshtha
Punurvasu & Uttara Ashada
Uttara Phalguni & Purva Bhadra Pada
Bharani & Anuradha
Pushyami & Purva Ashada
Hasta & Shatabishak
Krittika & Vishaka
Aslesha & Moola
Rohini & Svati
Magha & Revati
Ardra & Sravana
Purva Phalguni & Uttara Bhadra Pada
Mrigashira, Chitra & Dhanishta

Jataka Chandrika states that if this affliction is present it will destroy the couple even if there are other strong matchings. This is the most serious blemish, with no exceptions. I have seen Vedha between the Moons work in a few ways. One is that the couple gets involved and has huge difficulty in getting everything lined up to make a solid commitment, there is always an obstacle, or they simply get in each other's way. Or, they have great compatibility as indicated by all other methods, but never actually meet at a time when both are available to take advantage of what they may offer each other. I have never seen a couple with this blemish between their Moons work. There is no exception to Vedha.

# Rajju

Rajju binds the couple to misfortunes and indicates serious difficulties that arise 'out of the blue.'

Nakshatras are considered to fall into the following different body parts:
Feet: Asvinni, Aslesha, Magha, Jyeshtha, Moola, Revati.
Hip: Bharani, Pushyami, Purva Phalguni, Anuradha, Purva Ashada, Uttara Bhadra Pada.
Neck: Rohini, Ardra, Hasta, Svati, Sravana, Shatabishak.
Navel: Krittika, Punurvasu, Uttara Phalguni, Vishaka, Uttara Ashada, Purva Bhadra Pada.
Head: Mrigashira, Chitra, Dhanishta

The Nakshatras should fall in different divisions in order to provide happiness and protection from 'widowhood.'
If they both fall in the feet there will always be wandering.
If the both fall in the hip there will be poverty.
If they both fall in the navel there will be loss of children.
If they both fall in the neck the wife will die.
If they both fall in the head the husband will die.

Exception: If Rasi, Graha Maitra, Tara and Mahendra are present then Rajju need not be considered. If only one, two or three of these are present then Rajju will be only partially cancelled.

     I cannot over emphasize the importance of Rajju. Rajju indicates serious difficulties the like of which most are unable to overcome. Rajju is like a whirlpool that sucks a couple down; the more they try to get out of a difficulty the deeper they usually sink. I can't remember ever seeing a couple that claimed to be happy when this blemish was present. If Rajju is in the navel there is trouble with their creative urges merging. 'The children will die,' state the ancient texts. Literal translation no, but what one creates is their children.
     If Rajju is in the hips, 'there will always be poverty.' In this case the goals they have for themselves as well as the relationship tend to remain impoverished or unfulfilled. They are unable to support each other in their goals and progress is meager. There is also a tendency for the couple to have different view about just what is valuable.
     If Rajju is in the feet, 'there will always be wandering.' In this case all plans fail and go awry and there is difficulty in making adjustments and then despair usually sets in.
     If Rajju is in the head, 'the husband will die.' Generally I find this to cause difficulties with the male making choices to steer and maintain the relationship by being firm in direction. This is important, since male energy, which is a governed more by the head, has a higher capacity to make decisions and then stick to them, even when he doesn't feel like it at later time.
     If Rajju falls in the neck, 'the wife will die.' In this case I generally find that there is a low ability to look at all the options that may be available, the result being the female doesn't feel real good about the options, which can make the male falter, and then the relationship boggles down.

# Stridirga

General welfare, well being of the bride, gives long marital bliss.
The Nakshatra of the man should be at least 14 away from the woman's. Some say at least 9.

When there are at least 14 Nakshatras from the woman's from the man's the shortest flow of energy is from the man to the woman, allowing him to naturally play the masculine role and her to play the feminine. When there is less the shortest flow of energy is from her to him. This creates a flow of energy that forces her to play the masculine role and him them feminine. The result is a short circuit in their relationship. When there is less then 9 Nakshatras separating them this manifests at it's worse. The concept behind Strii-Diirgha is similar to Rasi Kuta. This is a very important matching, if it is not present then Rasi Kuta will also not be present, but if there is an exception for Rasi Kuta, then that exception also takes care of Strii-Diirgha.

# Rasi

Rasi is the zodiac sign

Check the rasi positions from each other. The count begins from the rasi the Moon is in. If they are:
2/12: If the man's rasi is 2nd from the woman's there will be death and evil results, but if the woman's rasi is 2nd from the man's there will be longevity.
3/11: If the man's rasi is 3rd from the woman's there will be misery and sorrow, but if the woman's is 3rd from the man's there will be happiness.
4/10: If the mans rasi is 4th from the woman's there will be poverty and enmity, but if the woman's rasi is 4th from the man's there will be wealth and happiness.
5/9: If the man's rasi is 5th from the woman's there will be unhappiness and widowhood, but if the woman's rasi is 5th from the man's there will be enjoyment and prosperity.
6/8: If the man's rasi is 6th from the woman's there will be loss of children, but if the woman's rasi is 6th from the man's then progeny will prosper.
7/7: When the rasis are 7th from each other there will be health, agreement, prosperity and special happiness.
Same: If the rasis are the same it is excellent if the planets fall in different Nakshatras and the man's Nakshatra precedes the women's. If they fall in the same Nakshatra, then it is unfavorable. The planets falling in the same Nakshatras is only OK in some Nakshatras and destructive in others.

Exception # 1: If both rasis are owned by the same planet or if the lords of the two rasis are friends the difficulties of not having Rasi Kuta get cancelled, though no points are given.
Exception # 2: If the rasi of the woman is odd the 6th is OK. If her rasi is even then the 2nd is OK. In these cases no great difficulties will be incurred, though no points will be earned. (Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and Aquarius are odd, the rest are even).

From the above it will be seen that it is better for the shortest distance to be from the man's rasi to the woman's. Energy will travel the path of least resistance, in this case the shortest distance between the Moons. If the shortest distance is from the man's Moon to the woman's it is better for the man to initiate and the women to receive; the man is the positive pole and the women the negative pole. This allows the man to feel confident and respected, and therefore loved; and the women to feel cherished and secure, and therefore loved. If the shortest distance is from the woman's Moon to the man's, the woman gets thrown into the initiative role, causing her to feel like the man does not think of her or care for her, and for the man to feel nagged.
